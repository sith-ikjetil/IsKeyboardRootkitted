# Is Keyboard Rootkitted
License: **GPL-3.0-or-later**  
  
This application, with its driver, detects SMM rootkit on keyboard by checking I/O APIC IRQ1 and IOTR0-IOTR4 for
an SMI trapped keyboard handler. If it detects it, you have been SMM rootkitted.

You need a driver signing certificate to have this work. This is the Windows version.
